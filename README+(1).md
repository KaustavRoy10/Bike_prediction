## General Information
- This project is for creating a linear regression model using python.Required to model the demand for shared bikes with the available independent variables 
-BoomBikes has recently suffered considerable dips, understand the demand for shared bikes among the people after this ongoing quarantine situation ends across the nation due to Covid-19
- Which variables are significant in predicting the demand for shared bikes and how well those variables describe the bike demands
- Dataset : day.csv | It has 16 columns and 730 rows of data


## Conclusions
- Conclusion 1 from the analysis : 7 features together generalize the data most significantly 
- Conclusion 2 from the analysis : temp, yr, lightsnow weather affect the target the most 
- Conclusion 3 from the analysis : r2 scores conclude that model is not overfitting and generalizes well
